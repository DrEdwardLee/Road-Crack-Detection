# Road-Crack-Detection 

**Dependencies**

1. **Clang**   : If working with linux, kindly install clang as the prefered C/C++ compiler for this project is clang.

2. **CMake** : To ensure portability we use cmake to generate the Makefiles

3. **OpenCV** : We rely heavily on OpenCV libs for this project. Opencv 3.0 (beta)

4. **Boost** : We would soon replace the stl containers with boost containers pretty soon for better portability and robustness.
